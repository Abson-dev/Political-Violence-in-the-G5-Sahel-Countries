    "2. Remove grid cells with less than 100 habitants using population data from WorldPop (pop_country)\n",
    "3. Identify grid cells with at least 10 conflict events per year using events_diffusion layer\n",

This measure is an assessment of the geographic distribution of conflict. Each country is divided into a 10km-by-10km spatial grid.

Next, ACLED determines how many of a country’s geographic grid cells experience a high level of violence, defined as at least 10 events per year (representing the top 10% of cases).\n",
